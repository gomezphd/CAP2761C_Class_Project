# Introduction

The main purpose of this project was to enable students to create various visualizations using Azure as a tool for developing quick visualizations from SQL for analysis and planning future visualizations with platforms such as Python, Power BI, or Tableau. Students were restricted to using only SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and Azure Data Studio with local instances as a way of learning these platforms. The project also aimed to help students gain proficiency in setting up a GitHub project repository with folders, subfolders, and various forms of data (ipynb, bak, sql, csv, xlsx, md) for the same project and personalizing a page.

The project involved intermediate-level SQL queries for creating visualizations to analyze the on-time performance of domestic flights in the United States during March 2024.

The project was completed with co-author Matthew Mullin.
